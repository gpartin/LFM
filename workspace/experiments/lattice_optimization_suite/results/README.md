# Workspace Results — Experiment Suite Outputs

**Role in hierarchy**: `workspace/` → `experiments/` → `lattice_optimization_suite/` → `results/`

**Purpose**  
Raw per-run outputs from lattice optimization experiments (timing, energy conservation, validation logs).

**Lifecycle**  
Active experiment data. Clean after analysis or curate significant results to `workspace/docs/evidence/` if promoting.

**Related folders**  
- `workspace/experiments/lattice_optimization_suite/` (parent experiment)
- `workspace/experiments/lattice_optimization_suite/analysis/` (post-processing)
- `DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md` (root map)
