Test GRAV-09 attempted to measure pure oscillation frequencies in two χ-potential wells (χA=0.30, χB=0.14, expected ratio 2.14) to validate gravitational time dilation. Multiple optimization attempts failed: (1) Cross-talk elimination via sequential isolation, (2) Float64 precision for energy conservation, (3) Wide Gaussian IC (σ=36 cells) to minimize k-content, (4) Full sampling (no stride) to eliminate aliasing. Root cause: Klein-Gordon dispersion relation ω²=c²k²+χ² couples spatial and mass terms inseparably. On discrete grid with dx=0.5, ANY localized excitation must be represented as Fourier sum with k_min=2π/L≈0.1, but measurement shows k≈2.26 (grid fundamental mode, 36% of k_max=π/dx≈6.28). This creates k²≈5.1 >> χ²≈0.04-0.09 (factor ~100), so both wells measure ω≈2.25 (ratio≈1.03), not isolated χ-frequencies. Measured ω/χ ratios (7-15×) confirm dispersion relation but prove test cannot isolate pure χ-oscillation. Key physics lesson: discrete grid imposes minimum wavelength λ_max=2L (periodic boundaries) and maximum wavelength λ_min=2dx (Nyquist limit), creating unavoidable k-content.
