## EMAIL TEMPLATE FOR RESEARCHERS

When reaching out to computational physicists about your work:

```
Subject: Computational Validation of Emergent Physics Framework - Collaboration Inquiry

Dear Dr. [Name],

I am writing to share a computational physics project that may interest you, given 
your work in [their research area].

I have developed and validated a framework demonstrating that gravitational, quantum, 
electromagnetic, and thermodynamic phenomena can emerge from a discrete Klein-Gordon 
equation with spatially-varying mass parameter. The validation suite includes 105 tests 
across 7 physics domains with 91.4% pass rate.

Complete documentation is publicly available:
- Manuscript: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/6AGN8
- Code: https://github.com/gpartin/LFM  
- Data: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17536484

Key results include:
• Lorentz invariance from discrete lattice (17/17 tests)
• Gravitational effects from field gradients (26/26 tests)
• Quantum bound states from potential wells (14/14 tests)
• EM-analogous behavior from field coupling (21/21 tests)
• Thermodynamic emergence from coarse-graining (5/5 tests)

I would welcome your feedback, critique, or potential collaboration. The framework 
raises interesting questions about emergence in computational physics that your 
expertise could help address.

All work is open-source (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) and reproducible on GPU workstations.

Best regards,
Greg D. Partin

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (Before Closing Browser)

### Upload Verification
- [ ] Navigate to https://osf.io/6agn8/files/
- [ ] Confirm `November_2025_Manuscript_Release` folder exists
- [ ] Open folder and verify all 4 priority files are present
- [ ] Click on PREPRINT_MANUSCRIPT.md and verify it displays correctly
- [ ] Check file size is reasonable (should be ~50-150 KB for markdown files)

### Discoverability Verification
- [ ] Open incognito/private browser window
- [ ] Search Google for: "Partin LFM emergent physics"
- [ ] Wait 24-48 hours, then verify OSF project appears in search results
- [ ] Search Google Scholar for: "Partin Lattice Field Medium"
- [ ] Wait 48-72 hours for Scholar indexing

### DOI Verification
- [ ] Go to https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/6AGN8
- [ ] Verify it resolves to your OSF project
- [ ] Check that DOI appears on project page
- [ ] Test DOI link from external site (copy/paste into new browser)

### Citation Verification
- [ ] Check that PREPRINT_MANUSCRIPT.md has citation information at bottom
- [ ] Verify HOW_TO_CITE.md has correct DOI (10.17605/OSF.IO/6AGN8)

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Upload fails or times out
**Solution**: 
- Check file size (should be < 5 MB for markdown files)
- Try uploading one file at a time
- Use wired internet connection if available
- Clear browser cache and try again

### Problem: DOI not assigned
**Solution**:
- OSF DOIs are usually automatic for public projects
- Check project settings → DOI section
- May need to request DOI if project was private initially
- Contact OSF support: support@osf.io

### Problem: Files won't display/preview
**Solution**:
- Markdown files may not preview in-browser (this is normal)
- Downloadable is more important than previewable
- Consider converting to PDF if preview is critical
- OSF supports .md, .pdf, .txt, .doc, .docx

### Problem: Project not appearing in search
**Solution**:
- Google indexing takes 24-72 hours
- Google Scholar takes 48-96 hours
- Make sure project is PUBLIC (not private or embargoed)
- Add more descriptive tags and keywords
- Share direct link on social media to speed up discovery

### Problem: Can't edit project description
**Solution**:
- Make sure you're logged in as project owner
- Check that project isn't in read-only mode
- Try different browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge)
- Contact OSF support if persistent
