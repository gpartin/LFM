# Commercial License Request

## Overview

The LFM (Lattice Field Medium) research framework is released under a **non-commercial, no-derivatives license** (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 for documentation and research artifacts). This protects the integrity of the theoretical work and ensures proper attribution during the IP protection and peer review period.

**Commercial use, derivative works, and proprietary applications require a separate paid license.**

---

## What Requires a Commercial License?

You need a commercial license if you plan to:

1. **Use LFM in commercial products or services**
   - Physics simulation engines for commercial software
   - Materials science applications for product development
   - Quantum computing implementations in proprietary systems
   - Integration into paid research tools or platforms

2. **Create derivative works for commercial purposes**
   - Modified versions of the simulation code
   - Proprietary extensions or optimizations
   - Commercial training materials or courses based on LFM
   - Integration into proprietary frameworks

3. **Sell or redistribute LFM-based solutions**
   - Software packages incorporating LFM algorithms
   - Cloud-based physics simulation services
   - Commercial consulting using LFM methodologies
   - Proprietary research platforms built on LFM

4. **Use in funded research with commercial intent**
   - Corporate R&D leading to patentable inventions
   - Government-funded projects with commercialization clauses
   - Academic-industry partnerships with licensing agreements

## What Is Allowed Without a License?

The following uses are **permitted under the non-commercial license**:

✓ Academic research and publication (with proper attribution)  
✓ Educational use in universities and non-profit institutions  
✓ Personal learning and experimentation  
✓ Non-commercial open-source projects (CC BY-NC-ND compliance required)  
✓ Replication studies and validation research  
✓ Non-commercial peer review and criticism

## How to Request a Commercial License

### Step 1: Submit Request

Email: **licensing@emergentphysicslab.com**

Include:
- Organization name and description
- Intended use case (products, services, research scope)
- Expected scale (users, deployments, revenue if applicable)
- Timeline for commercialization
- Geographic markets (if relevant)

### Step 2: Evaluation

We will review your request and respond within **5 business days** with:
- Licensing terms tailored to your use case
- Pricing structure (tiered, royalty-based, or one-time fee)
- Support and maintenance options (if applicable)
- Any restrictions or conditions

### Step 3: Negotiation & Execution

Once terms are agreed:
- Formal license agreement drafted
- Payment terms finalized
- License grant issued (perpetual or term-based)
- Technical support channel established (optional)

## Licensing Terms & Conditions

Commercial licenses are negotiated case-by-case but typically include:

- **Scope**: Specific products, services, or research projects covered
- **Duration**: Perpetual or fixed-term (e.g., 3-year renewable)
- **Territory**: Geographic regions where license applies
- **Exclusivity**: Non-exclusive by default; exclusive licenses available at premium
- **Attribution**: Commercial users must credit LFM authorship in documentation
- **Support**: Optional maintenance and update agreements
- **Sublicensing**: Generally prohibited without explicit permission
- **Audit rights**: Licensor may verify compliance with scope limits

---

## Pricing Structure (Guideline)

Pricing depends on:
- Organization size (startup, enterprise, research institution)
- Revenue impact (product sales, service fees, funded research value)
- Exclusivity requirements
- Geographic scope
- Support and customization needs

**Typical ranges:**
- **Startups/SMEs**: $5,000 - $25,000 annually or 2-5% royalty on LFM-derived revenue
- **Enterprise**: $50,000 - $250,000+ annually or custom royalty agreements
- **Academic-Commercial Partnerships**: Negotiated based on funding structure
- **Government/Defense**: Custom terms with security and IP considerations

*These are illustrative only; actual pricing determined during negotiation.*

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I evaluate LFM before requesting a license?**  
A: Yes—non-commercial research and internal prototyping are permitted. Contact us when ready to commercialize.

**Q: What if I'm a non-profit with some revenue?**  
A: If revenue is incidental (e.g., conference fees, cost recovery), non-commercial license likely applies. Contact us to clarify.

**Q: Can I contribute improvements back to the project?**  
A: Yes—see `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Contributions are under the same non-commercial license unless a commercial license separately negotiated.

**Q: What happens if I use LFM commercially without a license?**  
A: Unauthorized commercial use violates copyright and license terms. We will pursue remedies including injunctions, damages, and attorney fees.

**Q: Do you offer patent grants with commercial licenses?**  
A: Patent rights (if any) are addressed separately in commercial agreements. Contact licensing@ for details.

**Q: Can I get an expedited license for urgent projects?**  
A: Yes—indicate urgency in your request. We can fast-track evaluation for critical timelines.
