# Tier 3 — Energy Conservation Validation Achievements

Generated: 2025-11-11 14:06:22

## Overview

This tier validates energy conservation through Hamiltonian partitioning and dissipation analysis.

## Key Achievements

- **Total Tier 3 — Energy Conservation Tests**: 11
- **Tests Passed**: 11 (100.0%)

## Test Results Summary

| Test ID | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|| ENER-01 | PASS | Global conservation — short || ENER-02 | PASS | Global conservation — long || ENER-03 | PASS | Wave integrity — mild curvature || ENER-04 | PASS | Wave integrity — steep curvature || ENER-05 | PASS | Hamiltonian partitioning — uniform χ (KE ↔ GE flow) || ENER-06 | PASS | Hamiltonian partitioning — with mass term (KE ↔ GE ↔ PE flow) || ENER-07 | PASS | Hamiltonian partitioning — χ-gradient field (energy flow in curved spacetime) || ENER-08 | PASS | Dissipation — weak damping (exponential decay, γ=1e-3 per unit time) || ENER-09 | PASS | Dissipation — strong damping (exponential decay, γ=1e-2 per unit time) || ENER-10 | PASS | Thermalization — noise + damping reaches steady state || ENER-11 | PASS | Momentum conservation — two-packet collision |
## Significance

These validations demonstrate that energy conservation is maintained across all simulation regimes, providing confidence in the numerical implementation and physical correctness of the LFM framework.
