# Workspace Results Category Folders

**Role in hierarchy**: `workspace/` → `results/` → `{category}/`

**Purpose**  
Organize per-run outputs by physics domain. Each category contains test-specific subfolders with diagnostics, plots, and raw data.

**Lifecycle**  
These are working outputs; curate and promote significant artifacts to `workspace/docs/evidence/` for publication.

**Related folders**  
- `workspace/results/` (parent)
- `workspace/docs/evidence/` (publication-ready artifacts)
- `workspace/tests/` (tests that generate these outputs)
- `DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md` (root map)
