# Tier 6 — Multi-Domain Coupling Validation Achievements

Generated: 2025-11-15 07:36:48

## Overview

This tier validates cross-domain coupling phenomena where relativistic, gravitational, and quantum effects interact.

## Key Achievements

- **Total Tier 6 — Multi-Domain Coupling Tests**: 12
- **Tests Passed**: 12 (100.0%)

## Test Results Summary

| Test ID | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| COUP-01 | PASS | Relativistic + Gravitational Time Dilation (Phase 1) |
| COUP-02 | PASS | Wave Propagation Speed (1D Analytical Validation with L2 Convergence) |
| COUP-03 | PASS | Light Deflection During Transverse Motion (Phase 2) |
| COUP-04 | PASS | Bound State Energy Levels in χ-Well (Phase 2) |
| COUP-05 | PASS | Tunneling Rate Modulation by χ-Field (Phase 2) |
| COUP-06 | PASS | Wavepacket Collapse vs χ-Gradient Interference (Phase 3) |
| COUP-07 | PASS | EM Wave in χ-Gradient (Phase 1) |
| COUP-08 | PASS | Dynamic coupling - time-varying χ (Phase 2) |
| COUP-09 | PASS | Asymmetric coupling - directional energy transfer (Phase 2) |
| COUP-10 | PASS | Nonlinear coupling - self-interaction via χ feedback (Phase 2) |
| COUP-11 | PASS | Interference - coupled field mixing (Phase 2) |
| COUP-12 | PASS | Saturation - coupling strength limit (Phase 2) |

## Significance

These validations demonstrate that the LFM framework produces consistent physics across domain boundaries. Gravitational time dilation emerges from dispersion relations, light deflection remains Lorentz-invariant, and quantum confinement works in gravitational potentials - all from the same discrete field equation.
