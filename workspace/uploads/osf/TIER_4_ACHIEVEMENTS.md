## Key Achievements

- **Total Tier 4 — Quantization Tests**: 14
- **Tests Passed**: 14 (100.0%)

## Test Results Summary

| Test ID | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|| QUAN-01 | PASS | ΔE Transfer — Low Energy || QUAN-02 | PASS | ΔE Transfer — High Energy || QUAN-03 | PASS | Spectral Linearity — Coarse Steps || QUAN-04 | PASS | Spectral Linearity — Fine Steps || QUAN-05 | PASS | Phase-Amplitude Coupling — Low Noise || QUAN-06 | PASS | Phase-Amplitude Coupling — High Noise || QUAN-07 | PASS | Nonlinear Wavefront Stability || QUAN-08 | PASS | High-Energy Lattice Blowout Test || QUAN-09 | PASS | Heisenberg uncertainty — Δx·Δk ≈ 1/2 || QUAN-10 | PASS | Bound state quantization — discrete energy eigenvalues E_n emerge from boundary conditions || QUAN-11 | PASS | Zero-point energy — ground state E₀ = ½ℏω ≠ 0 (vacuum fluctuations) || QUAN-12 | PASS | Quantum tunneling — barrier penetration when E < V (classically forbidden) || QUAN-13 | PASS | Wave-particle duality — which-way information destroys interference || QUAN-14 | PASS | Non-thermalization — validates Klein-Gordon conserves energy (doesn't approach Planck) |
## Significance

These validations demonstrate that quantum mechanical behavior emerges from the classical Klein-Gordon equation with appropriate boundary conditions, suggesting a deep connection between field theory and quantum mechanics.
