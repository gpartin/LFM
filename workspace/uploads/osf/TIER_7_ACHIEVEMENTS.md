# Tier 7 — Thermodynamics & Statistical Mechanics Validation Achievements

Generated: 2025-11-10 17:04:45

## Overview

This tier validates thermodynamic observables emerging from statistical coarse-graining of time-reversible Klein-Gordon dynamics.

## Key Achievements

- **Total Tier 7 — Thermodynamics & Statistical Mechanics Tests**: 5
- **Tests Passed**: 5 (100.0%)

## Test Results Summary

| Test ID | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|| THERM-01 | PASS | Entropy Increase — Second Law of Thermodynamics || THERM-02 | PASS | Irreversibility — Arrow of Time || THERM-03 | PASS | Equipartition Theorem — Energy Distribution Across Modes || THERM-04 | PASS | Thermalization Timescale — Relaxation to Equilibrium || THERM-05 | PASS | Temperature Emergence — Boltzmann Distribution |
## Significance

These validations demonstrate that thermodynamics (entropy increase, arrow of time, equipartition, thermalization, temperature) emerges from coarse-grained observables of deterministic dynamics, validating Boltzmann's vision that macroscopic thermodynamics arises from microscopic mechanics. Despite the equation being Hamiltonian and energy-conserving (<0.01% drift), thermodynamic behavior emerges from phase mixing, numerical dissipation, and spatially-varying χ field.
