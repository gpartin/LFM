# Upload Staging — Category Plots

**Role in hierarchy**: `workspace/` → `docs/` → `upload/` → `plots/` → `{category}/`

**Purpose**  
Staging area for publication-quality plots organized by physics domain. Fed by build scripts that pull from `workspace/results/` and finalize for upload packages.

**Structure**  
```
plots/
  Electromagnetic/
    EM-01/ (figures for test EM-01)
    EM-02/
    ...
  Gravity/
  Energy/
  Quantization/
  Relativistic/
```

**Lifecycle**  
Generated by build scripts; do not hand-edit. Final packages assembled in `workspace/uploads/`.

**Related folders**  
- `workspace/docs/upload/` (parent staging area)
- `workspace/uploads/` (final packages)
- `workspace/results/` (source data)
