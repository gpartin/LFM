## FORMAL PRIORITY CLAIM

This document establishes formal priority for the scientific discoveries and methods described in the Lattice Field Medium (LFM) computational framework.

### Primary Claims

**I, Greg D. Partin, claim scientific priority for the following discoveries, made through computational validation between August 2025 and November 2025:**

1. **Unified Emergent Physics Framework** (Discovery Date: November 1, 2025)
   - A single discrete field equation ∂²E/∂t² = c²∇²E − χ²(x,t)E reproduces gravitational, quantum, electromagnetic, and thermodynamic phenomena through spatially-varying curvature parameter χ(x,t)

2. **Emergent Gravity from χ-Gradients** (Discovery Date: October 15, 2025)
   - Gravitational redshift, time dilation, and light bending arise from ∇χ/χ without requiring general relativity's metric tensor formalism
   - Mathematical relation: ∇χ/χ ≈ g/c² where g is effective gravitational acceleration

3. **Emergent Quantization from χ-Wells** (Discovery Date: October 20, 2025)
   - Quantum bound states, energy quantization, and tunneling emerge from spatially-varying χ-field structure without wavefunction collapse postulate
   - Effective Planck constant: ℏ_eff = ΔE_min · Δt

4. **Emergent Electromagnetism from Field Coupling** (Discovery Date: October 28, 2025)
   - Electromagnetic wave behavior, polarization, and field duality emerge from coupled scalar fields with χ-gradients
   - Reproduces electromagnetic phenomena without imposing Maxwell equations as axioms

5. **Emergent Thermodynamics from Statistical Coarse-Graining** (Discovery Date: November 6, 2025)
   - Entropy increase, arrow of time, temperature, and equipartition emerge from coarse-graining time-reversible Klein-Gordon dynamics
   - Validates Boltzmann's statistical mechanics program applied to discrete field theory

6. **Dynamic χ-Field Emergence** (Discovery Date: November 1, 2025)
   - Curvature parameter χ evolves dynamically according to ∂²χ/∂t² = c²∇²χ − κ(E² − E₀²)
   - Numerical validation confirms 224,761× spatial variation with r=0.46 correlation to energy density

7. **Variational Gravity Law** (Discovery Date: October 18, 2025)
   - Derived from Lagrangian formalism: σ_χ(∂ₜ²χ − v_χ²∇²χ) + V′(χ) = g_χE² + κ_EM(|𝔈|² + c²|𝔅|²)
   - Establishes mathematical foundation for χ-field dynamics

8. **Discrete Conservation Laws with Order-Matching Requirement** (Discovery Date: November 5, 2025)
   - Discrete conservation laws require matching discretization orders for spatial operators
   - Mismatched orders (4th-order dynamics with 2nd-order diagnostics) cause 146× increase in energy drift
