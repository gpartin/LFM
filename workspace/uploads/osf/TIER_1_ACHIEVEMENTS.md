## Overview

This tier validates Lorentz invariance, isotropy, and causality constraints.

## Key Achievements

- **Total Tier 1 — Relativistic Tests**: 15
- **Tests Passed**: 15 (100.0%)

## Test Results Summary

| Test ID | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|| REL-01 | PASS | Isotropy — Coarse Grid || REL-02 | PASS | Isotropy — Fine Grid || REL-03 | PASS | Lorentz Boost — Low Velocity || REL-04 | PASS | Lorentz Boost — High Velocity || REL-05 | PASS | Causality — Pulse Propagation || REL-06 | PASS | Causality — Noise Perturbation || REL-07 | PASS | Phase Independence Test || REL-08 | PASS | Superposition Principle Test || REL-09 | PASS | 3D Isotropy — Directional Equivalence || REL-10 | PASS | 3D Isotropy — Spherical Symmetry || REL-11 | PASS | Dispersion Relation — Non-relativistic (χ/k≈10) || REL-12 | PASS | Dispersion Relation — Weakly Relativistic (χ/k≈1) || REL-13 | PASS | Dispersion Relation — Relativistic (χ/k≈0.5) || REL-14 | PASS | Dispersion Relation — Ultra-relativistic (χ/k≈0.1) || REL-15 | PASS | Causality — Space-like correlation test (light cone violation check) |
## Significance

These validations demonstrate that special relativity emerges naturally from the LFM lattice framework without imposing it as an axiom.
