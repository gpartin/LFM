# LFM License Matrix

This matrix clarifies which licenses apply to each class of artifacts in this repository. Where a file contains an explicit license header, that header governs for that file. When unspecified, the defaults below apply.

  - License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 (Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0)
  - Rights: Free to share with attribution; no derivatives; no commercial use without prior written permission.

- Physics source code and tooling (workspace/src, workspace/tools, workspace/tests, workspace/experiments)
  - License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 (unless a file’s header states otherwise)
  - Rights: Non-commercial research and sharing with attribution; no distribution of modified material; commercial use requires prior written permission.

  - License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 (unless a file’s header specifies another license)

- Third‑party dependencies and libraries
  - Retain their original licenses (e.g., NumPy/SciPy BSD-3-Clause; CuPy MIT; React/Next.js MIT; TypeScript Apache-2.0). See NOTICE for details.
