# Author Verification Options for Greg D. Partin

## Current Situation
The repository identifies the author as "Greg D. Partin" with location "Los Angeles, CA USA" but provides no way for third parties to verify this is actually you (vs. someone else with the same name).

## Recommended Verification Methods

### Option 1: ORCID iD (RECOMMENDED for Academic Work)
**What:** ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) is a free, unique identifier for researchers.
**Why:** Industry standard for academic publications and research code.
**How:** 
1. Register at https://orcid.org/ (free, 2 minutes)
2. Add to README.md, LICENSE, and NOTICE:
   ```
   Author: Greg D. Partin
   ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000
   ```

### Option 2: LinkedIn Profile
**What:** Professional networking profile.
**Why:** Establishes professional identity and can show employment/education history.
**How:** Add to README.md and NOTICE:
   ```
   Author: Greg D. Partin
   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile
   ```

### Option 3: GitHub Profile Link
**What:** Your GitHub user profile.
**Why:** Already implied since it's your repo, but can make it explicit.
**How:** Add to README.md:
   ```
   Author: Greg D. Partin (https://github.com/gpartin)
   ```

### Option 4: Personal Website/Domain
**What:** Personal website with your research portfolio.
**Why:** Professional presence you control.
**How:** Register a domain (e.g., gregdpartin.com) and link it:
   ```
   Author: Greg D. Partin
   Website: https://gregdpartin.com
   ```

### Option 5: Academic/Institutional Affiliation
**What:** University or research institution affiliation.
**Why:** Provides institutional verification.
**How:** If affiliated with a university:
   ```
   Author: Greg D. Partin
   Affiliation: [University Name], Department of Physics
   Email: username@university.edu
   ```
**Note:** Since you're listed as "Independent" researcher, this may not apply.

### Option 6: Keybase/PGP Key
**What:** Cryptographic key for identity verification.
**Why:** Strongest cryptographic proof of identity.
**How:** 
1. Create PGP key or Keybase account
2. Add fingerprint to README:
   ```
   Author: Greg D. Partin
   PGP: 1234 5678 90AB CDEF 1234 5678 90AB CDEF 1234 5678
   ```

## Recommended Approach (Balanced)

Add to README.md, LICENSE, and NOTICE:

```markdown
**Author:** Greg D. Partin

**GitHub:** [github.com/gpartin](https://github.com/gpartin)  
**Contact:** latticefieldmediumresearch@gmail.com
```

This provides:
