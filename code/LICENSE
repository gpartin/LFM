SCOPE OF LICENSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This license applies to all components of the LFM project, including but not 
limited to:

1. All source code files (*.py)
2. All documentation files (*.md, *.txt)
3. All configuration files (*.json, *.yaml)

COMMERCIAL LICENSING INQUIRIES — FORMAL PROCEDURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you wish to use this software for commercial purposes, including but not 
limited to those listed in the "COMMERCIAL USE PROHIBITION" section above, 
you MUST follow this procedure:

STEP 1 — INITIAL INQUIRY:
Send a written request to:
  Email: gpartin@gmail.com
  Subject: LFM Commercial License Inquiry — [Your Company Name]

Your inquiry must include:
  a) Your full legal name and company/institution name
  b) Detailed description of intended commercial use
  c) Expected scope (users, revenue, duration)
  d) Contact information including phone and mailing address

STEP 2 — ACKNOWLEDGMENT:
The copyright holder will acknowledge receipt within 15 business days. If you 
do not receive acknowledgment, resend to the same address with "SECOND 
REQUEST" in the subject line.

STEP 3 — NEGOTIATION:
A commercial license agreement will be negotiated in good faith. Terms may 
include:
  - Perpetual or term-limited licenses
  - Field-of-use restrictions or unlimited use
  - Royalty-bearing or paid-up licenses
  - Exclusivity provisions
  - Custom support and development agreements
  - Minimum payment guarantees

STEP 4 — EXECUTION:
A formal written license agreement must be signed by both parties before any 
commercial use begins. Email exchanges alone do NOT constitute a valid 
commercial license.

IMPORTANT — NO IMPLIED LICENSE:
- Failure to receive a response does NOT grant permission for commercial use
- Sending an email inquiry does NOT create any rights or licenses
- Commercial use without a signed agreement is a material breach
- Good faith belief of permission is NOT a defense to infringement

  Greg D. Partin
  Email: gpartin@gmail.com
  (Physical address available upon reasonable request for legal service)

For expedited commercial licensing (within 48 hours), include "URGENT" in 
subject line and provide complete information in Step 1.
