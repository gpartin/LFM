Abstract
The Lattice-Field Medium (LFM) posits that spacetime is a deterministic lattice of interacting energy cells. Each cell evolves according to a discrete update rule whose continuum limit reproduces a variable-mass Klein–Gordon equation. This document unifies the conceptual framework and mathematical derivation of LFM, showing that classical, relativistic, gravitational, and quantum behaviors all emerge from one substrate law.
1. Conceptual Framework
Spacetime arises from local cell interactions where energy amplitude E(x,t) and curvature χ(x,t) evolve deterministically. The governing relation is ∂²E/∂t² = c²∇²E − χ²(x,t)E, with c² = α/β. Lorentz invariance and conservation arise intrinsically.
2. Core Equation and Physical Mapping
The canonical equation links field curvature and local stiffness, producing emergent relativistic and gravitational phenomena. In the continuum limit, χ acts as an effective mass or potential, yielding gravitational redshift, lensing, and quantized oscillations.
3. Derived Relations
Lorentz analogue: ω² = c²k² + χ²(x,t)
Energy conservation: ΣE(t+1) − ΣE(t) = 0
Quantized exchange: ΔE = nℏ_eff, ℏ_eff = ΔE_minΔt
4. Simulation Framework
Tier 1–3 simulations verify isotropy, Lorentz symmetry, and conservation with numerical precision. Phase 1 Test Design defines reproducibility protocols, orchestration logic, and proof-packet archives.
5. Physical Implications
LFM offers a deterministic substrate where relativity, quantization, and gravitation emerge naturally. Its χ-feedback mechanism provides a new lens on cosmic expansion and may reduce dependence on the cosmological constant.
6. Summary
Unified results from the Master and Core Equations show that a single discrete rule can generate all major field behaviors. Phase 1 validation confirms Lorentz isotropy, energy stability, and gravitational analogues, establishing a reproducible foundation.
