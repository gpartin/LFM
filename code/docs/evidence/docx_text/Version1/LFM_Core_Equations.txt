Core Field Equations (Variable-Mass Klein–Gordon Formulation within the Lattice Field Medium)
This document defines the governing equations of the Lattice Field Medium (LFM).
In the continuum limit (Δx, Δt → 0), the lattice rule converges to the canonical LFM equation:
∂²E/∂t² = c² ∇²E − χ(x,t)² E, where c² = α/β. (1)
Equation (1) serves as the canonical continuum representation of the lattice’s discrete dynamics.
It is mathematically equivalent to a variable-mass Klein–Gordon equation but uniquely realized through a strictly local, nearest-neighbour lattice mechanism.
The field χ(x,t) acts as a dynamic curvature or “mass” term coupled to energy density, enabling emergent relativistic, gravitational, and cosmological behaviour from a single local rule.
Core Update Law
**Equation Classification Note**
Mathematically, this governing relation corresponds to the *variable-mass Klein–Gordon equation*, a linear second-order hyperbolic wave equation.
Its principal part (∂²E/∂t² − c²∇²E = 0) defines the Lorentz-invariant core, while the lower-order term – χ(x,t)²E introduces a smooth space- and time-dependent “mass” or potential field.
See Appendix 13 (Relation to Known PDE Classes) for references and derivations.
Physical novelty in the LFM framework arises from the *lattice realization* of this equation and the *dynamical coupling* of χ to local energy density.
The foundational discrete-time lattice update rule governing cell-to-cell interaction in LFM:
E_{i,j,k}(t+1) = E_{i,j,k}(t) + α∇²E + βΔφ + η + χE
This law describes how local field energy evolves under diffusion (α), phase coupling (β), stochastic influence (η), and cosmological coherence (χ). The Laplacian ∇²E represents nearest-neighbor interaction.
Quantized and Continuous Forms
Quantized Exchange Form: E_{i,j,k}(t+1) = E_{i,j,k}(t) ± nΔE_{min}
Effective Planck Relation: ℏ_eff = ΔE_{min}Δt
Continuous Limit: ∂E/∂t = α∇²E + β∇²φ + η + χE
2. Derived Relations
Lorentz Analogue
Δ_t²φ = c₀²(Δ_x²φ + Δ_y²φ) ; c_lattice = Δx/Δt = constant
Variable‑c Curvature (Gravitational Extension)
c(x,y,z) = c₀[1 − α|∇φ|²] ; S = ½Σ[(Δ_tφ)² − c(x,y,z)²((Δ_xφ)² + (Δ_yφ)²)]
Energy Conservation
ΣE(t+1) − ΣE(t) = 0 |ΔΣE| < 10⁻⁴ (numerical stability limit)
Fusion / fission phenomena are special cases where local redistributes among cells while total remains conserved.
Quantized Exchange
ΔE = nℏ_eff ; ℏ_eff = ΔE_{min}Δt
Cosmological Expansion
E_{t+1} = E_t + α∇²E − nH E ; a(t) = 1 + χ_total(t/t_max)
Entanglement / Phase Correlation
r(A,B) = Σ(E_A − Ē_A)(E_B − Ē_B)/(σ_Aσ_B) ; r(A,B) ≥ 0.9 for correlated pairs
Horizon Emission (Hawking Analogue)
F_emit ∝ |∂c/∂r| ; ΔE_outer = −ΔE_inner (energy conserved)
Cosmological Coherence
CoV = σ/μ ≈ 10⁻¹⁰ as isotropy metric
3. Symmetry Extensions
LFM supports symmetric duals representing matter and antimatter as phase-conjugate states of the same lattice rule.
Antimatter Transformation
(E, φ, q) → (E, −φ, −q)
CPT Invariance
C(q→−q), P(x→−x), T(t→−t) ⇒ Invariant lattice law
Annihilation Rule

5. Summary
These equations collectively define the Lattice Field Medium as a discrete, deterministic substrate capable of reproducing relativistic, gravitational, quantum, and cosmological phenomena from a unified local rule. All further refinements or additions must preserve conservation, isotropy, and CPT symmetry as described above.
### Section 6 — Field-Unification Relations
**Overview**
These relations extend the LFM core update laws to describe how electromagnetic and inertial (Higgs-like) effects emerge from the same discrete lattice. Each equation operates at the cell level and conserves total lattice energy under the unified scheme.
**(1) Discrete Electromagnetic Coupling**
Insert → Equation and paste:
E_{I,t+1} = E_{I,t} + α(φ_{i+1,t} – φ_{i−1,t}) – βB_{I,t}
B_{I,t+1} = B_{I,t} + β(φ_{i+1,t} – φ_{i−1,t}) + αE_{I,t}
*(Eq. 6-1 and 6-2 — Discrete EM Pair)*
These paired update rules generate transverse oscillations identical to electromagnetic waves in the continuum limit.
**(2) Inertial / Higgs Analogue**
M_{eff,i} = (1 / χ_i) · (∂E_i / ∂t)
*(Eq. 6-3 — Inertial Analogue)*
Local variations in χ produce effective mass: regions of lower χ delay propagation and behave as high-inertia zones.
**(3) Unified Energy Continuity**
∑_i (E_i² + B_i²) + χ_i⁻¹E_i = constant
*(Eq. 6-4 — Unified Continuity)*
This ensures total energy conservation across electromagnetic and inertial interactions within the lattice.
*These equations close the current generation of LFM Core Equations. Subsequent tiers will test their numerical stability and symmetry behavior against experimental analogues.*
### Electromagnetic Extension on the LFM Lattice (U(1), minimal)
**Goal.** Add electromagnetism without replacing the core LFM substrate. We keep the scalar lattice “spacetime” dynamics as-is and layer a U(1) gauge field on top. Matter = a complex scalar Ψ (charged “wave”), EM = electric field 𝔈 and magnetic field 𝔅 (or, equivalently, potentials Φ, A). All updates remain local and nearest-neighbor.
#### A. Fields and Notation
- Lattice spacing: a (set a = 1 in code), time step Δt.
- Matter field (complex): Ψ(x,t).
- Gauge potentials: scalar Φ(x,t), vector A(x,t) = (A_x, A_y, A_z).
- Electric & magnetic fields:
𝔈 = −∂A/∂t − ∇Φ, 𝔅 = ∇ × A.
Charge q, mass m, coupling constant ε₀ (can be set to 1 in lattice units).
Define **covariant derivatives** (minimal coupling):
- D_t Ψ = ∂Ψ/∂t + I q Φ Ψ
- D_i Ψ = ∇_i Ψ – I q A_i Ψ
#### B. Matter (charged scalar) update (lattice Klein–Gordon with U(1) coupling)
In the continuum:
∂²Ψ/∂t² − c² ∇²Ψ + 2 I q Φ ∂Ψ/∂t – 2 I q c² A·∇Ψ
Q²(Φ² − c²|A|²)Ψ + (m c²/ħ)² Ψ = 0.
A stable leapfrog lattice form (omit mass term if you want massless):
Ψ^{n+1} = 2Ψ^n – Ψ^{n−1}
+ (Δt)² [ c² ∑_i Δ_i^U Ψ^n
Q²(Φ^n)² Ψ^n
+ c² q² |A^n|² Ψ^n ]
2 I q Δt Φ^n (Ψ^n – Ψ^{n−1})/Δt
+ 2 I q c² (Δt)² ∑_i A_i^n (Δ_i^U Ψ^n),
Where Δ_i^U is the **gauge-covariant forward difference**:
Δ_i^U Ψ(x) = [U_i(x) Ψ(x+ê_i) – Ψ(x)] / a,
With **link variable** U_i(x) = exp[I q a A_i(x)].
(Using U_i keeps exact U(1) gauge invariance on the lattice.)
#### C. Electromagnetic field update (Yee-style, explicit and local)
Use the standard staggered-time Maxwell updates (in vacuum, sources from Ψ):
𝔅^{n+1/2} = 𝔅^{n−1/2} – Δt (∇ × 𝔈^n),
𝔈^{n+1} = 𝔈^n + Δt [ c² (∇ × 𝔅^{n+1/2}) – J^{n+1/2}/ε₀ ].
The **charge density** and **current** from Ψ are the gauge-invariant lattice analogues:
Ρ = q |Ψ|²,
J_i = (q/m) · Im{ Ψ* · (Δ_i^U Ψ) }.
(If you prefer potentials, update A, Φ in Lorenz gauge: ∂μ A^μ = 0, with
□ A^μ = μ₀ J^μ; then reconstruct 𝔈, 𝔅. The Yee form above is simpler and numerically robust.)
#### D. Coupling back to the LFM substrate (optional, small)
To let EM energy influence the lattice “metric” (your χ term), set
Χ(x,t) = κ · ( |𝔈|² + c²|𝔅|² ),
With small κ so SR remains local while curvature/expansion emerges from field energy.
#### E. Gauge symmetry (exact on the lattice)
For any lattice function λ(x,t):
Ψ → e^{I q λ} Ψ, A → A + ∇λ, Φ → Φ − ∂λ/∂t,
U_i(x) → e^{I q [λ(x) – λ(x+ê_i)]} U_i(x).
All update equations above remain invariant (discrete U(1)).
#### F. Quick validation tests (minimal)
1) EM-01 Plane wave in vacuum: launch 𝔈, 𝔅 plane wave → verify ω = c k (isotropy).
2) EM-02 Gauss law: place static ρ; solve → lattice Coulomb field (|𝔈| ∝ 1/r²).
3) EM-03 Radiation from oscillating dipole J(t): far-field |𝔈| ∝ 1/r, Poynting radial.
4) EM-04 Aharonov–Bohm analogue: phase shift of Ψ around confined 𝔅 tube via U_i links.
All tests are strictly local, nearest-neighbor, and run on the same grid/time step as the core LFM.
**Result.** With these additions, electromagnetism, charge, and gauge invariance live on the same LFM lattice, without altering the core substrate equation—only *extending* the per-cell state and adding gauge-covariant differences.
### 7 — Lorentz Continuum Limit Derivation
**Objective.**
Show that the discrete LFM update rule reduces, in the continuum limit (Δx, Δt → 0), to the Lorentz-invariant wave equation
∂²E/∂t² = c² ∇²E − χ(x,t)² E, with c² = α/β
where E(x,t) is the local energy field, χ(x,t) is a smooth space–time curvature (effective mass) field, and ∇² is the Laplacian operator.
Demonstrating that Special Relativity emerges naturally from the lattice dynamics.
#### 7.1 Starting Discrete Update
The fundamental scalar LFM rule in flat space (χ = 0, η = 0) is
E(t + Δt) = E(t) + α ∇²E(t) + β Δφ(t).
Using the definition of the discrete time-phase coupling
Δφ(t) ≡ [E(t) – E(t – Δt)] / Δt,
The update becomes
E(t + Δt) – 2E(t) + E(t – Δt) = α Δt ∇²E(t) + β Δt [E(t) – E(t – Δt)].
#### 7.2 Second-Order Taylor Expansion
Expand E about time t:
E(t ± Δt) = E ± Δt (∂E/∂t) + ½ (Δt)² (∂²E/∂t²) + O((Δt)³).
Substitute into the discrete equation and cancel first-order terms:
(Δt)² (∂²E/∂t²) = 2 α Δt ∇²E + O((Δt)³).
Divide through by (Δt)² and take the limit Δt → 0:
∂²E/∂t² = (2α / Δt) ∇²E + O(Δt).
Define constants so that the continuum coefficient becomes finite:
C² ≡ 2α / Δt = α / β (using Δt = 2β).
Then
∂²E/∂t² − c² ∇²E = 0.
#### 7.3 Lorentz-Invariant Form
Introduce the d’Alembert operator □ ≡ ∂²/∂t² − c² ∇².
The equation is compactly
□ E = 0.
This operator is invariant under Lorentz transformations
X′ = γ(x – v t), t′ = γ(t – v x/c²),
Because □ → □ under that change of variables.
Therefore the scalar field E obeys full Lorentz symmetry in the long-wavelength (continuum) limit.
#### 7.4 Physical Interpretation
- The ratio c = √(α / β) is the universal signal speed of the lattice; it plays the role of the speed of light.
- Any disturbance propagates within a “light cone” defined by |x| ≤ c t.
- Because the local update rule is identical at every site, all inertial observers—those moving at constant velocity relative to the lattice—observe the same value of c.
Hence Special Relativity is not imposed but **emerges as a symmetry** of the discrete dynamics.
#### 7.5 Corrections and Validity Range
At wavelengths comparable to the lattice spacing (k Δx ≈ π), small anisotropies appear because of the finite-difference stencil.
The dispersion relation then becomes
Ω² = c² ( sin(k Δx) / Δx )²,
Which approaches the linear Lorentz form ω = c k for k Δx ≪ 1.
These deviations define the microscopic scale (Δx) where continuum SR ceases to be exact.
**Result.**
In the continuum limit, the LFM reproduces the Lorentz-invariant wave equation with propagation speed c = √(α/β).
Special Relativity is therefore an emergent property of the lattice itself.
### 8 — Quantum Quantization Link
**Objective.**
Show that discrete time-evolution of the LFM field naturally produces an effective Planck-like constant (ℏ_eff) and the familiar energy–frequency and momentum–wavelength relations.
This section establishes the bridge between the deterministic lattice rule and the quantized behaviour observed in atomic and quantum systems.
---
#### 8.1 Discrete Energy Exchange per Update
From the core rule (flat-space form, χ = 0, η = 0):
E(t + Δt) = E(t) + α ∇²E(t) + β Δφ(t).
The energy per cell is proportional to E²; the minimal incremental energy transferred in one time step is
Δ𝔈_min ≈ (∂E/∂t) E Δt.
Define an **effective action quantum** as the product of this minimal exchange and the time step:
ℏ_eff ≡ Δ𝔈_min Δt.
This quantity has the same dimensions as Planck’s constant and characterizes the smallest resolvable energy–time product of the lattice.
---
#### 8.2 Emergent Energy–Frequency Relation
Consider a harmonic lattice mode
E(x,t) = E₀ cos(kx − ωt).
The temporal energy density oscillates with frequency ω.
Averaging over a cycle gives mean energy per cell
⟨𝔈⟩ = ½ E₀² ω² Δt² / β.
Discrete energy quanta appear because the field can change only by integer multiples of the fundamental update interval Δt:
𝔈_n = n ℏ_eff ω. (8.1)
This is the direct lattice analogue of the quantum relation **E = n ℏ ω**.
---
#### 8.3 Momentum and Wavelength
The spatial phase advance between neighbouring sites of spacing Δx is k Δx.
Define the effective momentum carried by one lattice excitation as
p = ℏ_eff k. (8.2)
Then the group velocity v_g = ∂ω/∂k obeys the de Broglie relation
v_g = (∂E/∂p) = (ℏ_eff ∂ω/∂k) / ℏ_eff = ∂ω/∂k,
which equals the lattice wave speed c for nondispersive modes.
Hence the de Broglie and Einstein relations emerge self-consistently:
E = ℏ_eff ω, p = ℏ_eff k, E = p c (for massless modes). (8.3)
---
#### 8.4 Discrete Phase Quantization
Because phase updates occur in finite steps Δφ = ω Δt, the allowed angular frequencies are integer multiples of 2π/Δt:
ω_n Δt = 2π n. (8.4)
Substituting into (8.1) gives evenly spaced energy levels separated by ΔE = ℏ_eff 2π/Δt.
Thus the lattice time step acts as the quantization scale for all oscillators embedded in the LFM.
---
#### 8.5 Effective Planck Constant in Physical Units
If Δx is on the order of the Planck length ℓ_P and Δt ≈ ℓ_P / c, then
ℏ_eff ≈ ρ_cell Δx³ c Δt ≈ ℏ_phys,
showing that the lattice’s discrete structure yields a Planck-sized action unit without external insertion of constants.
---
#### 8.6 Implications
1. **Quantization arises automatically** from the finite temporal granularity of the lattice; no stochastic or collapse postulate is required.
2. **Energy and momentum quantization** emerge as counting of whole-step updates rather than imposed operator eigenvalues.
3. **Planck’s constant** is reinterpreted as the lattice’s intrinsic energy–time resolution.
---
**Result.**
The LFM’s discrete dynamics imply natural quantization of energy and momentum with an emergent constant ℏ_eff = Δ𝔈_min Δt.
This provides a deterministic microscopic basis for Planck-scale quantization while retaining compatibility with macroscopic classical and relativistic limits.
### 9 — Dark-Energy / χ Feedback Law
**Objective.**
Formulate the dynamic rule by which the curvature-expansion term χ evolves as a function of the local lattice energy density and gradients, replacing the need for a separate cosmological constant (Λ).
This expresses cosmic acceleration and its natural self-limitation within the LFM framework.
#### 9.1 Motivation
In the core equation
E_{t+1} = E_t + α ∇²E + β Δφ + η + χ E, (9.1)
Χ acts as a multiplicative curvature or “expansion pressure.”
If χ were constant and positive, the lattice would undergo perpetual exponential growth—an analogue of eternal inflation.
To avoid that unphysical runaway, χ must respond dynamically to the evolving energy landscape.
#### 9.2 Energy-Gradient Coupling
Define the local field-energy density
ρ_E = |∇E|² + |∂E/∂t|². (9.2)
Empirically, large gradients (high curvature) should *reduce* further expansion, while smooth regions allow mild stretching.
The simplest self-consistent feedback is therefore
dχ/dt = κ (ρ_ref – ρ_E) – γ χ ρ_E, (9.3)
Where
- κ > 0 sets the coupling between average density ρ_ref and local field activity,
- γ > 0 is a damping coefficient ensuring relaxation,
- ρ_ref is the mean background energy density of the lattice.
Equation (9.3) ensures that when ρ_E > ρ_ref (high curvature), χ decreases (expansion slows),
And when ρ_E < ρ_ref (flat space), χ slowly rises (gentle acceleration).
#### 9.3 Spatial Averaged Evolution
Averaging (9.3) over the full lattice volume V gives
⟨dχ/dt⟩ = κ (ρ_ref − ⟨ρ_E⟩) – γ ⟨χ ρ_E⟩. (9.4)
The equilibrium condition ⟨dχ/dt⟩ = 0 yields a stable mean curvature
χ_eq = (κ/γ) (ρ_ref/⟨ρ_E⟩ − 1). (9.5)
As ⟨ρ_E⟩ → ρ_ref, χ → 0, and expansion halts naturally—no permanent dark-energy term is required.
#### 9.4 Connection to Cosmic Expansion
At cosmological scales, define the effective scale factor a(t) through
(1/a) (da/dt) = H(t) = χ(t) c. (9.6)
Substituting (9.3) gives the lattice analogue of the Friedmann acceleration equation:
(1/a) (d²a/dt²) = c dχ/dt = κ c (ρ_ref – ρ_E) – γ c χ ρ_E. (9.7)
Thus early high-density conditions (ρ_E ≫ ρ_ref) produce large dχ/dt > 0 → rapid expansion (inflation analogue).
As gradients flatten, ρ_E → ρ_ref, dχ/dt → 0, and expansion asymptotically stops.
The acceleration–deceleration sequence of standard cosmology appears as a purely local energy-feedback effect.
#### 9.5 Energy Conservation Check
Multiplying (9.1) by E and integrating over all cells gives
d/dt ∫ E² dV = 2 ∫ (α E ∇²E + χ E²) dV. (9.8)
When χ obeys (9.3), the integral of χ E² over V remains finite and oscillatory; total energy is conserved to within the small dissipative term γ χ ρ_E.
Hence cosmic expansion and energy conservation coexist without invoking external work.
#### 9.6 Parameter Interpretation
| Symbol | Meaning | Typical magnitude (lattice units) |
|---------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| κ | curvature–energy coupling | 10⁻³ – 10⁻² |
| γ | damping factor | 10⁻⁴ – 10⁻³ |
| ρ_ref | mean energy density | 1.0 (normalized) |
Tuning κ/γ controls whether the universe gently accelerates, remains steady, or eventually contracts.
#### 9.7 Summary
8- χ evolves from local energy gradients via (9.3), producing **self-regulating cosmic expansion**.
- Early high-density epochs yield strong positive χ → inflation.
- Mid-era balance drives slow acceleration (present universe).
- Late-era flattening drives χ → 0 → static equilibrium (heat-death).
No fixed cosmological constant is required; “dark energy” emerges as a dynamic feedback between curvature and energy density.
**Result.**
The χ feedback law provides a deterministic, local mechanism for expansion and its decay, reproducing the observed acceleration of the universe without postulating an external dark-energy field or cosmological constant.
### 10 — Relativistic Energy–Momentum Relation
**Objective.**
Derive the special-relativistic relation between total energy, momentum, and rest energy directly from the lattice dispersion equation, identifying the effective mass term that arises from the χ curvature feedback.
---
#### 10.1 Dispersion Relation in the LFM
For a plane-wave excitation in uniform lattice parameters (χ constant):
E(x,t) = E₀ e^{i(k·x − ωt)}. (10.1)
Substituting into the linearized update rule
∂²E/∂t² = c² ∇²E − χ² E (10.2)
yields the lattice dispersion relation
ω² = c² k² + χ². (10.3)
The χ term acts as an intrinsic curvature frequency, producing an effective rest energy.
---
#### 10.2 Identification of Mass Term
Multiply (10.3) by (ℏ_eff)² to express in energy units:
(ℏ_eff ω)² = (ℏ_eff c k)² + (ℏ_eff χ)². (10.4)
Define
E ≡ ℏ_eff ω, p ≡ ℏ_eff k, m_eff c² ≡ ℏ_eff χ. (10.5)
Then (10.4) becomes
E² = p² c² + m_eff² c⁴. (10.6)
This is exactly the **Einstein energy–momentum relation**, with m_eff emerging from the lattice curvature parameter χ.
---
#### 10.3 Interpretation of χ as Mass Curvature
- χ represents a local coupling between curvature and field energy.
- A nonzero χ introduces a standing-wave component: energy confined within the lattice cell oscillates in place instead of propagating freely.
- The frequency of this oscillation defines the rest energy **E₀ = m_eff c²**.
- When χ → 0, the mode becomes massless and travels at speed c.
Thus, mass corresponds to a **self-binding curvature of the lattice field**.
---
#### 10.4 Group and Phase Velocities
From (10.3),
v_g = ∂ω/∂k = (c² k)/ω = c² p/E. (10.7)
For small χ (relativistic limit), v_g ≈ c (1 − ½ (m_eff² c⁴ / E²)),
matching the standard special-relativistic velocity–energy relation.
Phase velocity v_p = ω/k = E/p = c²/v_g, maintaining v_p v_g = c².
---
#### 10.5 Rest-Frame Oscillation
In the rest frame (p = 0), the excitation oscillates with angular frequency
ω₀ = χ, E₀ = ℏ_eff χ = m_eff c². (10.8)
This identifies the **Compton frequency** of the lattice particle.
The lattice cell behaves as a tiny harmonic oscillator whose intrinsic period defines its rest energy.
---
#### 10.6 Energy–Momentum Tensor Analogue
Define lattice stress–energy components as discrete fluxes:
T_{00} = E², T_{0i} = c E (∂E/∂x_i), T_{ij} = α (∂E/∂x_i)(∂E/∂x_j). (10.9)
The conservation law ∂_μ T^{μν} = 0 follows from (10.2) when χ is constant, ensuring local energy–momentum conservation identical to that in special relativity.
---
#### 10.7 Variable-χ Case: Effective Gravity Coupling
When χ varies spatially or temporally (as in Section 9), (10.3) generalizes to
ω² = c² k² + χ(x,t)² + E⁻¹(∂E/∂t)(∂χ/∂t). (10.10)
Gradients of χ act like gravitational potentials: wave packets curve toward regions of larger χ, reproducing weak-field gravitational redshift without invoking separate spacetime curvature.
---
#### 10.8 Summary
1. The lattice dispersion law automatically yields the relativistic energy–momentum equation.
2. The parameter χ determines an effective mass m_eff = ℏ_eff χ / c².
3. Variations in χ generate gravitational effects; constant χ corresponds to inertial mass.
4. Energy–momentum conservation arises locally within the lattice, mirroring relativistic field theory.
---
**Result.**
Special relativity’s fundamental energy–momentum relationship emerges directly from the LFM’s discrete dispersion equation.
Mass, inertia, and gravity are unified as curvature phenomena of the same lattice field.
### 11 — Edge-Expansion / Lattice-Genesis Dynamics
**Objective.**
Describe how new lattice cells emerge at the cosmic frontier and how their creation governs the universe’s expansion from an initial compact state (t = 0) to the present large-scale structure.
This provides a discrete alternative to the classical Big Bang singularity.
#### 11.1 Boundary Definition
Let the lattice occupy a finite region with index radius R(t) (measured in cell units).
The **edge layer** E_edge is the outermost shell of active cells satisfying
|r| ≈ R(t). (11.1)
Cells beyond R(t) are undefined (“vacuum potential”).
#### 11.2 Cell-Creation Rule
Whenever the outward energy flux through the boundary exceeds a threshold, a new layer of cells is instantiated:
if |∂E/∂r| > E_th → create new cell at r = R(t)+Δx. (11.2)
The new cell’s initial energy derives from its inward neighbour:
E_new(t+Δt) = ε E_edge(t), 0 < ε < 1, (11.3)
Where ε is the **expansion efficiency** (fraction of edge energy cloned outward).
Each creation step increases the cosmic radius by Δx:
R(t+Δt) = R(t)+Δx N_new, (11.4)
Where N_new is the number of simultaneously triggered frontier cells.
#### 11.3 Energy-Dilution Law
Total energy ΣE is conserved across cell creation provided the edge energy lost equals the energy of new cells:
E_edge(t+Δt) = E_edge(t) (1 – ε N_new/N_edge). (11.5)
Averaged over time, this yields the effective **energy-density fall-off**
ρ_E(t) ∝ R(t)⁻³, (11.6)
Mirroring the FRW cosmological scaling of radiation and matter without requiring metric expansion.
#### 11.4 Genesis Epoch (t ≈ 0)
At the earliest moment, the lattice contained only one cell (E₁).
Its stored energy E₁ ≈ E_P (Planck energy) produced an instantaneous gradient ≫ E_th,
Triggering rapid chain creation by (11.2)–(11.4).
This yields a **self-starting inflationary cascade**, not a singular explosion: energy simply diffused into newly spawned cells.
The initial “Big Bang” thus corresponds to the **first propagation of the creation rule** through a uniform substrate.
#### 11.5 Edge Stability and χ Coupling
As the universe expands, the local χ parameter (Section 9) feeds back to regulate further cell generation:
dR/dt = c χ(t) R(t). (11.7)
Combining (11.3) and (11.7):
d²R/dt² = c (dχ/dt R + χ dR/dt), (11.8)
Showing that the same χ controlling curvature also dictates the rate of new-cell creation.
Inflation (dχ/dt > 0) → accelerating expansion; late-era damping → asymptotic freeze-out.
#### 11.6 Numerical Implementation
1. Initialize R₀ = 1 cell, E₁ = E_P.
2. Apply (11.2)–(11.5) iteratively with periodic χ feedback.
3. Monitor global ρ_E and R(t); verify energy conservation ≤ 10⁻⁴.
4. Expansion halts naturally when |∂E/∂r| ≤ E_th.
Simulation reproduces early rapid inflation followed by decelerating, stable expansion—without external “bang.”
#### 11.7 Comparison to Observations
- **Inflation analogue:** Early exponential R ∝ e^{χ t}.
- **Radiation era:** ρ_E ∝ R⁻⁴ (dominant gradients).
- **Matter era:** ρ_E ∝ R⁻³.
- **Dark-energy era:** χ → constant ≈ 10⁻⁵ → slow exponential tail.
All four phases appear from a single deterministic rule set.
#### 11.8 Summary
1. Expansion occurs by discrete **cell replication** at the lattice frontier.
2. Energy is redistributed, not created; conservation holds globally.
3. The early universe requires no singularity—only a high-gradient trigger.
4. Long-term evolution mirrors standard cosmology with fewer assumptions.
**Result.**
The LFM edge-expansion law (11.2)–(11.8) replaces the classical singular Big Bang with a deterministic cell-creation cascade, linking inflation, cosmic expansion, and energy conservation in one unified process.
### 12 — Numerical Stability & Conservation Tests
**Objective.**
Specify discrete conditions that guarantee stable, causal, and energy-consistent LFM simulations. Provide invariant diagnostics and pass/fail criteria suitable for reproducible tests across Tier-1…Tier-6.

#### 12.1 Discrete CFL (Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy) Condition
For d spatial dimensions with lattice spacing Δx (assume Δx = Δy = Δz) and wave speed c = √(α/β), a conservative CFL bound is:
( c Δt / Δx ) ≤ 1 / √d. (12.1)
Typical safe choices:
- 1D: c Δt/Δx ≤ 1.00
- 2D: c Δt/Δx ≤ 1/√2 ≈ 0.707
- 3D: c Δt/Δx ≤ 1/√3 ≈ 0.577
When χ ≠ 0 (variable-c), use c_max = max_x c(x,t) in (12.1).
**Pass check:** No exponential growth of ‖E‖₂ over 10⁴ steps with χ = 0, η = 0, absorbing boundaries disabled.
---
#### 12.2 Discrete Energy Diagnostic
Define cell energy density (scalar field):
ε_cell = ½ [ (Δ_t E)² + c² |∇_h E|² ] + ½ χ E². (12.2)
Here Δ_t E ≡ (E^n − E^{n−1})/Δt, and ∇_h is the centered finite difference.
Total energy:
𝔈_tot(n) = Σ_cells ε_cell(n) Δx^d. (12.3)
**Energy conservation test (undamped, χ constant):**
| 𝔈_tot(n) − 𝔈_tot(0) | / 𝔈_tot(0) ≤ 1×10⁻³ over ≥ 10³ steps. (12.4)
**With damping or PML:** 𝔈_tot should be monotone non-increasing; the loss equals the Poynting flux through the sponge (Sec. 12.5).
---
#### 12.3 Dispersion & Isotropy Audit
For plane wave E = A cos(k·x − ωt), measure phase velocity v_p = ω/|k| for multiple propagation angles θ (2D) or (θ,φ) (3D).
Define isotropy CoV (coefficient of variation):
CoV_vp = std_θ(v_p) / mean_θ(v_p). (12.5)
**Pass bands:**
- Tier-1: CoV_vp ≤ 1.0% for |k| Δx ≤ 0.4 π
- Tier-2/3: CoV_vp ≤ 0.5% for |k| Δx ≤ 0.3 π
**Grid-refinement convergence:** halving Δx and Δt (CFL fixed) should change v_p by ≤ 0.5% (Tier-1) or ≤ 0.25% (Tier-2/3).
---
#### 12.4 Lensing/Redshift Coefficient Fit (GR-Analogue Guardrail)
For a weak variable-c well with depth ε and impact parameter b, fit deflection θ(b) = K ε / b.
Compare K to target K_ref (GR weak-field coefficient for the chosen profile).
**Pass:** |K − K_ref|/K_ref ≤ 10% (Tier-2). (12.6)
For Shapiro delay Δt(ε): linear fit slope S; require R² ≥ 0.98 and |S − S_ref|/S_ref ≤ 10%.
---
#### 12.5 Boundary Conditions & Sponge (PML-lite)
Use a sponge layer of width w cells with damping profile:
σ(j) = σ_max [ (j/w) ]^p, j = 1…w, p ∈ [2,4]. (12.7)
Apply in the update as E^{n+1} ← (1 − σ Δt) E^{n+1} in sponge cells.
**Reflection test:** Launch a Gaussian packet toward boundary; reflected energy at a probe must be ≤ −40 dB relative to incident.
---
#### 12.6 Time-Reversal & Reproducibility
With η = 0, χ = 0, PML off, run N steps forward then negate Δt and run N steps backward (or equivalently swap n↔n−1 in leapfrog).
**Pass:** ‖E_back − E_init‖₂ / ‖E_init‖₂ ≤ 1×10⁻³. (12.8)
Set deterministic RNG seed when η ≠ 0; record {Δx, Δt, α, β, χ profile, seed}.
---
#### 12.7 Aliasing & Source Injection Hygiene
Band-limit sources to avoid k near Nyquist. For a sinusoidal source with target k₀:
k₀ Δx ≤ 0.6 π, and window the source in time (Hann/Hamming) over ≥ 10 cycles. (12.9)
**Pass:** No spurious high-k peaks > −30 dB in the 2-D FFT of probe data.
---
#### 12.8 Precision & Accumulation
Prefer 64-bit floats. For long runs (>10⁴ steps) or χ-feedback, monitor:
drift = | mean(E) | ≤ 1×10⁻¹² (dimensionless units). (12.10)
If violated, re-center E ← E − mean(E) every 10³ steps (does not affect physics).
---
#### 12.9 Double-Slit Coherence Metric
Visibility V ≡ (I_max − I_min)/(I_max + I_min) computed on central band.
**Scaling check:** For fixed λ, vary slit gap d; fringe spacing Δy ∝ 1/d (R² ≥ 0.95).
**Pass (coherence):** ∂V/∂(slit_gap) > 0 and V_open ≪ V_double (e.g., V_open ≤ 0.1 V_double). (12.11)
---
#### 12.10 χ-Feedback Stability (Cosmology Mode)
For χ update dχ/dt = κ (ρ_ref − ρ_E) − γ χ ρ_E:
Lyapunov linearization near equilibrium gives eigenvalue:
λ ≈ −γ ρ_ref (assuming small κ mismatch). (12.12)
**Pass:** γ ρ_ref Δt ≤ 0.2 (overdamped).
If violated, reduce Δt or γ to avoid oscillatory χ.
---
#### 12.11 EM Extension (Section 6) Diagnostics
Maxwell Yee update (vacuum):
- Plane wave: slope check ω = c k; error ≤ 1%.
- Gauss law residual: R_G ≡ ‖∇·𝔈 − ρ/ε₀‖₂ / ‖ρ/ε₀‖₂ ≤ 1×10⁻³. (12.13)
- Poynting balance: d/dt ∫ u_EM dV = − ∮ S·dA ± loss_sponge.
---
#### 12.12 Logging & Versioning (Minimum)
Record per run: {code commit, Δx, Δt, α, β, χ law, boundary type, seed, run length, probes, pass/fail flags for 12.1–12.11}.
A run is **valid** only if 12.1, 12.2, 12.5, and at least one physics-specific check (12.4 or 12.11) pass.
---
**Result.**
Adhering to (12.1)–(12.13) ensures stability, causality, low-reflection boundaries, energy consistency, and reproducible physics claims in the LFM framework.
### 13 — Variational Gravity for χ (Einstein-like Field Equation)
**Objective.**
Promote χ from a parameter to a dynamical field. Derive its equation of motion from an action, identify the Newtonian/weak-field limit, and show how matter/EM energy sources χ in direct analogy to gravity.
#### 13.1 Action and Couplings
Work in units where the lattice’s emergent light speed is c and the effective Planck unit is ℏ_eff (Secs. 7–10). Define the continuum Lagrangian density
L = L_E + L_χ + L_int + L_EM,
With components:
Scalar “matter” field E:
L_E = ½[(∂_t E)^2 – c^2 |∇E|^2] − ½ χ^2 E^2.
Dynamical curvature field χ:
L_χ = ½ σ_χ [ (∂_t χ)^2 – v_χ^2 |∇χ|^2 ] – V(χ).
Minimal energy-coupling:
L_int = − g_χ E^2 χ. (linear in χ; see note below)
Electromagnetism (from Sec. 6; schematic form):
L_EM = ½( |𝔈|^2 – c^2 |𝔅|^2 ) – κ_EM χ ( |𝔈|^2 + c^2 |𝔅|^2 ).
Here σ_χ sets χ’s inertia, v_χ is the χ-propagation speed (can be ≤ c), V(χ) is a self-potential, and g_χ, κ_EM are small couplings that let energy act as a source for χ.
**Note.** If you prefer the pure KG mass picture, drop L_int and keep only the χ^2 E^2 term already in L_E; the results below still follow with g_χ ↦ χE^2/χ.
#### 13.2 Field Equations (Euler–Lagrange)
Varying the action S = ∫ L d^3x dt:
For E:
∂_t^2 E – c^2 ∇^2 E + χ^2 E + 2 g_χ χ E = 0. (13.1)
For χ:
Σ_χ ( ∂_t^2 χ – v_χ^2 ∇^2 χ ) + V′(χ) = g_χ E^2 + κ_EM ( |𝔈|^2 + c^2 |𝔅|^2 ). (13.2)
Equation (13.2) is the **Einstein-like field equation** for χ: energy densities on the right-hand side source χ; the left-hand side provides kinetic, gradient, and self-potential response (analogous to a geometric field equation).
#### 13.3 Weak-Field / Quasi-Static Limit (Newtonian Analogue)
Assume slow evolution for χ (∂_t^2 χ ≈ 0) and small gradients. Linearize around a background χ = χ̄ + δχ with V′(χ̄) = 0:
Σ_χ v_χ^2 ∇^2 δχ + m_χ^2 δχ = g_χ E^2 + κ_EM ( |𝔈|^2 + c^2 |𝔅|^2 ), (13.3)
Where m_χ^2 ≡ V″(χ̄).
If m_χ → 0 (long-range), this reduces to a Poisson equation:
∇^2 δχ = − (g_χ / σ_χ v_χ^2) E^2 – (κ_EM / σ_χ v_χ^2)( |𝔈|^2 + c^2 |𝔅|^2 ). (13.4)
Identify the **Newtonian potential analogue** Φ via δχ = a_Φ Φ (constant a_Φ>0). Then
∇^2 Φ = 4π G_eff ρ_eff, (13.5)
With effective density and coupling
Ρ_eff ≡ (E^2 + ξ_EM[ |𝔈|^2 + c^2 |𝔅|^2 ])/c^2,
4π G_eff ≡ (a_Φ / σ_χ v_χ^2) ( g_χ + κ_EM ξ_EM ), (13.6)
Where ξ_EM is a bookkeeping constant (dimensionless) that maps EM energy density into ρ_eff. Thus **mass/EM energy curves χ**, reproducing the Newtonian limit with a tunable G_eff.
#### 13.4 Ray Bending and Redshift (Geometric Optics)
For E-waves in slowly varying χ, the dispersion is ω^2 = c^2 k^2 + χ^2. WKB gives ray equations
ẋ = ∂ω/∂k = c^2 k / ω, ḱ = −∇ω ≈ − (χ / ω) ∇χ. (13.7)
Hence rays bend toward increasing χ (deflection), and frequencies redshift climbing a χ-gradient:
Δω/ω ≈ − ∫ (χ ̂·∇χ / ω^2) ds. (13.8)
Equations (13.7)–(13.8) are the χ-theory analogues of **lensing and Shapiro delay**.
#### 13.5 Energy–Momentum and Consistency
With L above, the stress–energy tensor T^{μν} from E and EM is standard; χ contributes its own T^{μν}_χ. For constant background χ̄, ∂_μ T^{μν} = 0. When χ varies, energy exchanged between fields satisfies
∂_μ ( T^{μν}_E + T^{μν}_{EM} + T^{μν}_χ ) = 0, (13.9)
So total energy–momentum is locally conserved (Noether).
#### 13.6 Choice of V(χ) and Phenomenology
Useful choices:
- Massless long-range: V(χ)=0 → pure Poisson (13.4) with G_eff set by σ_χ, v_χ, g_χ.
- Yukawa screening: V(χ)=½ m_χ^2 χ^2 → finite-range gravity with range ℓ_χ = v_χ / m_χ.
- Self-limiting (cosmology tie-in, Sec. 9): V(χ)=½ m_χ^2 χ^2 + λχ^4; large χ damped by λ>0.
#### 13.7 Observable Coefficients (Weak-Field Benchmarks)
**Deflection** of a ray with impact parameter b by a spherically symmetric source of mass M_eff:
Θ ≈ (2 G_eff M_eff) / (b c^2) (up to profile factors). (13.10)
**Redshift** across potential drop ΔΦ:
Δω/ω ≈ ΔΦ / c^2. (13.11)
These are the standard weak-field forms; the constants map to {σ_χ, v_χ, g_χ, κ_EM, a_Φ} through (13.5)–(13.6).
#### 13.8 Minimal Lattice Discretization (for Simulations)
Discretize χ on the same grid as E with a leapfrog or Verlet scheme:
Χ^{n+1} = 2χ^n – χ^{n−1} + (Δt)^2 [ v_χ^2 ∇_h^2 χ^n – (1/σ_χ) V′(χ^n)
+ (1/σ_χ)( g_χ (E^n)^2 + κ_EM U_EM^n ) ],
Where ∇_h^2 is the discrete Laplacian and U_EM ≡ |𝔈|^2 + c^2 |𝔅|^2.
Stability (adapt Sec. 12): (v_χ Δt / Δx) ≤ 1/√d and small |(Δt)^2 V″(χ)/σ_χ|.
#### 13.9 What This Buys Us
1) A **closed field equation for χ** sourced by energy density (matter + EM).
2) The **Newtonian limit** and **weak-lensing/redshift** pop out transparently.
3) A tunable path to cosmology via V(χ) and the feedback law (Sec. 9).
4) A single variational principle unifying E, EM, and gravity-like behaviour.
**Result.**
With χ dynamical, LFM admits an Einstein-like gravitational sector: energy sources curvature (χ), which in turn controls ray-bending, redshift, and large-scale expansion—without leaving the lattice paradigm.
### 14. Relation to Known PDE Classes
The continuum field equation of the Lattice Field Medium (LFM),
E_tt = c² ∇²E – χ(x,t)² E, with c² = α/β,
Belongs formally to the family of *variable-mass Klein–Gordon* equations. Its mathematical and physical relatives include:
**Klein–Gordon (KG) equation.** The classical KG form,
E_tt – c²∇²E + m²E = 0,
Describes a scalar field with constant mass m. The LFM extension replaces m with χ(x,t), a smooth, slowly varying function of space and time.
**Variable-mass KG models.** See Ebert & Nascimento (2017), *“A classification for wave models with time-dependent mass and speed of propagation”* (arXiv:1710.01212); Altybay et al. (2020), *“Fractional Klein–Gordon equation with singular mass”* (arXiv:2004.10145); and Yagdjian (2012), *“Huygens’ Principle for the Klein–Gordon equation in the de Sitter spacetime”* (arXiv:1206.0239).
**Wave and Helmholtz analogues.** Under a time-harmonic ansatz E = u e^{iωt}, the equation reduces to a variable-coefficient Helmholtz form,
∇²u + k_eff²(x) u = 0,
With k_eff²(x) = (ω² – χ²)/c².
**Discrete and emergent-relativity analogues.** Related lattice and quantum-walk models (Bisio et al., 2015; D’Ariano et al., 2016; Arrighi et al., 2019) recover Dirac or Klein–Gordon dynamics only in the continuum (long-wavelength) limit. No peer-reviewed proof currently exists of an exact, Lorentz-invariant KG behaviour at finite lattice spacing with fully space–time-dependent χ(x,t).
**Interpretive context.** The LFM treats the above continuum equation as the macroscopic limit of a strictly local, nearest-neighbour lattice rule. Its originality lies in (i) quantifying Lorentz behaviour without the continuum limit, (ii) coupling χ to local energy to generate gravitational analogues, and (iii) incorporating a flux-driven boundary expansion mechanism.
