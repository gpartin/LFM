LFM Phase 1 Test Design (v1.0)
Date: 2025-10-22
Prepared by: Greg D. Partin
Project: Lattice Field Medium (LFM)
Objective: Define the architecture and plan for reproducible Tier 1–3 validation testing.
1. Purpose
Phase 1 establishes the complete design for the LFM Proof-of-Concept Validation System. The goal is to build a modular, reproducible environment demonstrating the correctness of Tiers 1–3, create a foundation for higher tiers and expert review, and conform to modern reproducible-science standards.

3. Folder & File Architecture
C:\LFM\code — Source modules and Tier kernels
C:\LFM\config — JSON configuration and validation thresholds
C:\LFM\runs — Runtime folders per experiment
C:\LFM\results — Metrics, plots, and summaries
C:\LFM\logs — Execution and environment logs
C:\LFM\packages — Proof-packet archives
4. Configuration & Validation Logic
Global tolerances are defined in /config/validation_thresholds.json, Tier-specific overrides in /config/tierN_default.json. Merge order: global → local → runtime overrides. Config keys include tier, parameters, tolerances, run_settings, and notes.
5. Test Scope
The tests must consist of valid physics equations that rigorously test the LFM model.
6. Orchestration & Parallelism
run_all_tiers.py reads /config/orchestration.json to schedule tiers and variants with a concurrency limit (default 3). Each run executes run_tier.py, writes results and metrics, and aggregates to /results/<campaign>/summary_overall.json.
7. Visualization & Reporting
Plots are auto-generated under /results/<campaign>/<tier>/<variant>/plots/, with summary_dashboard.html combining metrics across all tiers. Each plot (energy_vs_time, anisotropy_vs_time, etc.) follows scientific style conventions.
8. Expert Review Packaging Workflow
After the final Tier completion, the system builds a proof packet: /packages/LFM_ProofPacket_<campaign>_vX.Y.zip, containing README, manifest, environment info, configs, code snapshot, results, logs, and hashes. SHA-256 integrity and optional Cardano anchoring ensure reproducibility.
