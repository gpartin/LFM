# Analysis & Reports (Archive)

This folder consolidates analysis reports and implementation notes that previously lived at the project root.

Moved here for organization and easier discovery:

- TIER_RUNNER_ANALYSIS.md — Standardization analysis of tier runners
- TEST_OUTPUT_ANALYSIS.md — Scientific output requirements and gaps
- OUTPUT_REQUIREMENTS_SUMMARY.md — Executive summary of required outputs
- OUTPUT_GAP_ANALYSIS.md — Heatmap and stats of missing outputs

If you don't find a former root-level .md report, check `archive/implementation_notes/` for historical notes.
