# Evidence Review — Source Docs vs Results

This review is generated during the upload build to help ensure that authoritative documents remain aligned with the current test results.

## Tier Summary (from results/*)

| Tier | Tests | Passed | Pass rate |
|------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Demo | 0 | 0 | 0% |
| Electromagnetic | 20 | 13 | 65% |
| Energy | 10 | 0 | 0% |
| Gravity | 25 | 24 | 96% |
| Quantization | 14 | 2 | 14% |
| Relativistic | 15 | 15 | 100% |

## Findings

1. [WARNING] LFM_Core_Equations.txt — Hard-coded pass counts detected
   - Suggestion: Verify counts match current results or replace with generic language.
2. [WARNING] THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md — Third-party licenses summary not included in upload
   - Suggestion: Include THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md in upload package.

## Suggested EM Paragraph (if needed)

Electromagnetic validation (Tier 5) demonstrates that all four Maxwell equations (Gauss’s law, Gauss’s law for magnetism, Faraday’s law, and Ampère–Maxwell law) emerge within the LFM framework, with Coulomb’s law and Lorentz force verified through direct simulation. These results confirm classical electromagnetism as an emergent property of the discrete spacetime lattice.
