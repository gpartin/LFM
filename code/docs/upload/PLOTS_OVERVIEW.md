# Plots and Visualizations Overview

## Representative Scientific Visualizations

This package includes key plots that demonstrate the major theoretical achievements of the Lattice-Field Medium framework.

### Included Plots

#### Relativistic Physics
- **relativistic_dispersion.png**: Demonstrates proper relativistic dispersion relations emerging from the discrete lattice

#### Quantum Mechanics  
- **quantum_interference.png**: Shows quantum interference patterns in double-slit experiments
- **quantum_bound_states.png**: Visualizes quantum bound state formation in potential wells

### Plot Generation

All plots are generated from actual simulation data using the LFM computational framework. Each visualization represents validated theoretical predictions that match analytical expectations.

### Additional Visualizations

The complete results directory contains extensive additional plots covering:
- Gravitational field analogues
- Energy conservation demonstrations  
- Electromagnetic field visualizations
- Quantization emergence plots
